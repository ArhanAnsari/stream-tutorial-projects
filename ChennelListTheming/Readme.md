For example, the navigation bar will look like that of the WhatsApp iOS app. The top bar will mimic that of Facebook Messenger. You will add a tab bar and compose button clones of WhatsApp and Twitter Chat to the footer section of the screen. In addition, the footer will have a non-sticky button that will disappear on a scroll like LinkedIn chat. 


## Getting Started
This tutorial requires a blank SwiftUI project with the integration of the Stream SDK. However, it will not cover how to set up the SDK. If you are new to Stream and need help setting up the project, check out the quick start guide tutorial.
To begin, create a SwiftUI app with the name `ChannelListTheming` using Xcode and add the SwiftUI SDK using Swift Package Manager.
